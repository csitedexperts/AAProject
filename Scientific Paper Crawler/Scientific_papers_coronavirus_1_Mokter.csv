"25	A contemporary view of coronavirus transcription	https://jvi.asm.org/content/81/1/20.short	Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped", plus-stranded RNA viruses with helical nucleocapsids and extraordinarily large genomes. The hallmark of coronavirus transcription is the production of multiple subgenomic mRNAs that contain sequences corresponding to …
"35	Identification of a novel coronavirus in bats	https://jvi.asm.org/content/79/4/2001.short	Exotic wildlife can act as reservoirs of diseases that are endemic in the area or can be the source of new emerging diseases through interspecies transmission. The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) highlights the …",
"65	An enteric coronavirus infection of cats and its relationship to feline infectious peritonitis.	https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/6267960	An enteric coronavirus that is antigenically closely related to feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is ubiquitous in the cat population. This virus has been designated feline enteric coronavirus to differentiate it from FIPV. The virus is shed in the feces by many seropositive …",
"72	Coronavirus genomics and bioinformatics analysis	https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/2/8/1804	The drastic increase in the number of coronaviruses discovered and coronavirus genomes being sequenced have given us an unprecedented opportunity to perform genomics and bioinformatics analysis on this family of viruses. Coronaviruses possess the largest …",

"87	Coronavirus minus-strand RNA synthesis and effect of cycloheximide on coronavirus RNA synthesis.	https://jvi.asm.org/content/57/1/328.short	The temporal sequence of coronavirus plus-strand and minus-strand RNA synthesis was determined in 17CL1 cells infected with the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). MHV-induced fusion was prevented by keeping the pH of the medium below pH 6.8. This had no …",
"88	Isolation of coronavirus envelope glycoproteins and interaction with the viral nucleocapsid.	https://jvi.asm.org/content/33/1/449.short	The two envelope glycoproteins and the viral nucleocapsid of the coronavirus A59 were isolated by solubilization of the viral membrane with Nonidet P-40 at 4 degrees C followed by sucrose density gradient sedimentation. Isolated E2 consisted of rosettes of peplomers …",
